Please read the PDF for the detailed problem statement and solution explanation.

HW_3_1: Draw the network showing node names, the links, and the cost of each link.

HW_3_1_Short_Path_CPM_BEllman_Ford: This uses Bellman-Ford Algorithm and does the following:
1.Accepts the number the cost of each link.
2.Provides the following output:
i. A graph of the network showing node names and link costs.
ii. The lowest cost path between the two specified nodes.
iii. The resulting Minimum Cost.

HW_3_3_Transport: This does the following:

1.Accepts the input values for the production limits, product costs, demand limits and demand prices, and shipment costs.
2.Provides the following output:
i. A graph of the network showing node names.
ii. The solution to the problem (number of loaves produced by each
plant, the number of loaves shipped from each plant to each chain,
and the total profit.

HW_3_4_Scheduling: Considers a hospital system consisting of three operating rooms and solves a scheduling problem.

HW_3_5_Transshipment: Solves Transshipment and Production problem for a Drone manufacturing system and does the following:

1.Accepts the input values for the production constraints, demand, and
transportation costs.
2.Provides the following output:
i. A graph of the network showing node names and costs.
ii. The solution to the problem (number of drones shipped over each link
and the resulting total cost).
